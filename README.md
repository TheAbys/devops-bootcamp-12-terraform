# Documentation

Terraform is well documented at https://registry.terraform.io/
Finding providers and how to use them is very easy. Even over Google you'll find results fast.

# Using Terraform with AWS

We need to use the aws provider and look up how to configure it
It requires the Access Key and Secret Key. This secret information must be stored in a secret and not plain text.
Also the aws provider must be downloaded through being configured in providers.tf and 

    terraform init

Official providers must not be defined in providers.tf, but its good practise.



# 4 - Resources & Data Sources

Previously the secret key and access key were defined within Terraform.
This seems to make problems with specific characters within those values.
Setting them instead through environment variables works.

Resources are used to create resources for example in the cloud.

Data Sources are used to load data from existing resources e.g. a VPC-ID by the default flag.

# 5 - Change & Destroy Terraform Resources

Use the command to apply the desired state (main.tf) to the AWS account

    terraform apply

Changes, Updates, Deletes are made through the file

    terraform apply

or

    terraform plan

show the changes that are being done.

Deletion through other commands is possible, but the best practise is to do it within the .tf file as this way the desired state is always documented.

    terraform destroy -target aws_subnet.dev-subnet-2

# 6 - Terraform commands

No approve necessary with command

    terraform apply -auto-approve

Delete/cleanup the complete infrastructure
    
    terraform destroy

# 7 - Terraform state

The terraform state can be view in the terraform.tfstate file, but if the infrastructure is getting bigger it's hardly readable.
There a command to show and list the state does exist.

    terraform state
    terraform state list
    terraform state show <name>

Within the terraform.tfstate.backup the previous state is stored.

# 8 - Output Values

Is used to output generated ids to console after the state was applied.

# 9 - Variables in Terraform

Multiple variables can be defined with different types like a string or list or a list of objects or whatever.
Variables can be passed through -var "<varname>=<varvalue>" or through a .tfvars file. Manual input is also possible for testing.
The terraform.tfvars file is automatically detected, if another name is used for seperation like -dev, -prod, ... the file must be named through -var-file 

    terraform apply -var-file terraform-dev.tfvars

# 10 - Environment Variables in Terraform

You can set the environment variables and then apply the terraform state, but the environment variables are not persistant.

    export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=
    export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=
    terraform apply -var-file terraform-dev.tfvars

global configuration

    ls ~/.aws/credentials
    aws configure

Custom environment variable

    export TF_VAR_avail_zone="eu-central-1a"

TF_VAR tells terraform it is a global variable, must be defined in terraform

    variable avail_zone{}

# 11 - Create Git Repository for local Terraform Project

Adding a .gitignore for not versioning specific or sensitive Terraform files

# 12 - Automate Provisioning EC2 with Terraform - Part 1

Updated the terraform script so a custom vpc and subnet is created.
AWS automatically generates a routing table for this vpc. Per default this routing table only contains a route definition for routing inside the vpc.
For communication outside this vpc a internet gateway must be defined.

With

    terraform state show aws_vpc.myapp-vpc i can see the resource definition if it is existing

# 13 - Automate Provisioning EC2 with Terraform - Part 2

Defining a EC2 instance in terraform.

Create a ssh key within AWS, store the .pem file in ~/.ssh/ and change its permissions

    chmod 400 ~/.ssh/server-key-pair.pem

This is required, otherwise aws will block the access!

# 14 - Automate Provisioning EC2 with Terraform - Part 2

Use a manually local created ssh key and automatically execute shellscripts on the created server.

# 15 - Provisioners in Terraform

Provisioners should only be used as a last resort, the provisioners are not idempotent
Best practise is to give that tasks to configuration management tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet or Saltstack

# 16 - Modules in Terraform - Part 1

Specific tasks like creating a VPC in AWS can be put into a module and therefore reused.
There are a lot of predefined modules from the providers so that not everyone has to create an own VPC module.
Still it is possible to create your own module.
